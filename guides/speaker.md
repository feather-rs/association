# Speaker
The job of the speaker is to lead the General Assembly and to make sure everyone is heard. Also, the Speaker must make sure that members don't speak at the same time.

The Speaker will be given speaking permission in the discord channel and will control who else has permission to speak at any given time. There will be a text channel where members can request permission to speak.

The Speaker is also in charge of managing votings and doing resolutions.
