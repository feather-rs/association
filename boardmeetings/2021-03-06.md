## 1Password

- Amber proposes to use 1Password to share passwords between board members
- Available to open source projects for free if they apply

## What role should the Association have?

- Defman brings forth the question whether the association should have a role in managing the feather-rs GitHub organization
- Schuwi is of the opinion that GitHub management should stay separate for now
- Miro proposes that the association has the ability to take on executive roles on the GitHub org in case caelunshun is not available
- Miro, amber and Schuwi agree to keep caelunshun the "benevolent dictator" of the GitHub organization
- Defman proposes that a sub group of board members who caelunshun approves such that they can appoint more maintainers to repositories in the GitHub org
- Defman proposes that 4 board members are owners of the GitHub organization such that they can execute the decisions of the board: Caelunshun, Schuwi, amber, Defman
- The consensus is that it comes down to the decision between appointing three board members beside caelunshun as write access to the org vs one admin access and two write access
- Proposal to appoint amber, Defman, Schuwi with write access to the GitHub org and revisit in max 3 months to appoint one of them admin. this is completely at caelunshun's discretion. caelunshun agrees to inform the board with a reason in case he kicks one of the organization members
- Vote to appoint amber, Defman, Schuwi with write access to GitHub org - Unanmiously in favor

### What should these board members actually do?

- Proposal to merge bugfix PRs at an individuals discretion but other PRs need at least 2 reviews from someone with write access to the organization via GitHub's code review function to   - no objections
- In 3 months time we will revisit a discussion about the association becoming owner of the GitHub organization

## Feather PR

- Should we promote feather?
- Defman proposes to have someone responsible for PR
- caelunshun raises the concern of people promoting feather at not good times in the past
- caelunshun proposes a blog post on the plugin system
- Schuwi proposes promoting in https://this-week-in-rust.com/
- It is concluded to talk about concrete plans for promotion at a later time
- amber and caelunshun are interested in taking on a role in this matter

## Feather documentation

- PauMAVA and OxKitsune are appointed to keep a look at documentation

## Merge association fork
